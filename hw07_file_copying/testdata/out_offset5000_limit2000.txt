se read the How to Write Go Code document, which describes some essential concepts about using the Go tools.

Installing extra Go versions
It may be useful to have multiple Go versions installed on the same machine, for example, to ensure that a package's tests pass on multiple Go versions. Once you have one Go version installed, you can install another (such as 1.10.7) as follows:

$ go get golang.org/dl/go1.10.7
$ go1.10.7 download
The newly downloaded version can be used like go:

$ go1.10.7 version
go version go1.10.7 linux/amd64
All Go versions available via this method are listed on the download page. You can find where each of these extra Go versions is installed by looking at its GOROOT; for example, go1.10.7 env GOROOT. To uninstall a downloaded version, just remove its GOROOT directory and the goX.Y.Z binary.

Uninstalling Go
To remove an existing Go installation from your system delete the go directory. This is usually /usr/local/go under Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD or c:\Go under Windows.

You should also remove the Go bin directory from your PATH environment variable. Under Linux and FreeBSD you should edit /etc/profile or $HOME/.profile. If you installed Go with the macOS package then you should remove the /etc/paths.d/go file. Windows users should read the section about setting environment variables under Windows.

Getting help
For help, see the list of Go mailing lists, forums, and places to chat.

Report bugs either by running “go bug”, or manually at the Go issue tracker.
